## ⚙️ Configuration

All features work without any configuration. The only optional setting is an AI API key for the AI Assist tab.

```yaml
# AI provider (anthropic / openai / groq / gemini)
ai_provider: anthropic

# Your API key for the selected provider — leave empty to disable AI features
ai_api_key: ""

# Enable HA persistent notifications when issues are detected (default: true)
notifications_enabled: true

# Enable scheduled daily health scans (default: false)
scheduled_scan_enabled: false

# Enable automatic orphan cleanup during scheduled scans (default: false)
auto_cleanup_enabled: false

# Debug logging — only enable when reporting issues (default: false)
debug_mode: false
```

> 💡 **Save and restart the app after any configuration change.**

## ✅ Health Tab

Runs a full system health scan and shows:

- 🎯 **A–F grade** with 0–100 score
- 🗄️ **Database Health** — size, fragmentation, orphaned stats and entities
- 💾 **Backup Insights** — disk usage, backup count and size, breakdown chart
- 💡 **Recommendations** — actionable steps for every detected issue
- 📚 **Proactive solutions** — auto-matched KB articles for your specific problems

### 🧹 Database cleanup

The **Cleanup** button removes orphaned stats and entities in batches. **VACUUM** compacts the database file. Both are safe and reversible by HA's own recorder.

## 🛡️ Security Tab

8-point security assessment with weighted scoring:

| Check | Weight | What it detects |
|---|---|---|
| 🔐 Two-Factor Authentication | 25% | TOTP 2FA active on your account |
| 🔒 SSL/HTTPS | 20% | HTTPS configured with a valid certificate |
| 🏠 HA Version | 10% | Running the latest Home Assistant Core |
| 🔄 Core Auto-Update | 10% | Automatic updates enabled |
| 📦 Apps up to date | 10% | All installed apps on their latest version |
| 🌐 Trusted Networks | 10% | No dangerous CIDR blocks (e.g. 0.0.0.0/0) |
| 🚫 IP Ban Protection | 10% | Brute-force protection active |
| ⚠️ Login Attempt Threshold | 5% | Max failed logins before IP ban |

> 💡 Hover the **ⓘ** icon next to each check for a plain-language explanation.

### Why Core Auto-Update matters

HA Core does **not** auto-update by default. Without it, security patches and integration fixes are not applied automatically.
Enable it at: **Settings → System → Updates → Automatically update Home Assistant Core**.

## 📚 Knowledge Base

- 🐙 GitHub Issues (home-assistant/core)
- 💬 Community Forum threads

## 🤖 AI Assist

The AI tab requires a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) API key. Supported providers:

| Provider | Key source |
|---|---|
| 🟣 Anthropic (Claude) | console.anthropic.com |
| 🟢 OpenAI (GPT) | platform.openai.com |
| 🔵 Groq | console.groq.com |
| 🔷 Gemini | aistudio.google.com |

Add your key in **Settings → Apps → Synctacles Care → Configuration**.

### 🔍 Diagnose

Describe any Home Assistant issue in plain language. The AI:
- Reads your live HA logs in real time
- Cross-references your configuration and entity states
- Provides step-by-step diagnostics with actionable fixes

> 💶 **Estimated cost:** ~€0.01–0.25 per session depending on model and complexity.

### 🩻 Config Doctor

Analyzes your automations with AI:

1. Select an automation from the list
2. AI reads the YAML and cross-references all entity_ids against your running HA instance
3. View detected issues and a proposed fix with a side-by-side diff
4. Apply with one click — **an automatic backup is created first**
5. Restore the original at any time with **Rollback**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Health scan fails**
- Check app logs: Settings → Apps → Synctacles Care → Log
- Requires Home Assistant 2024.1 or newer
- Supervisor API must be accessible (enabled by default)

**AI Assist not available**
- Add an API key in Configuration (see AI Assist section above)
- Click "Check API status" in the AI tab to verify the key works

**Config Doctor shows no automations**
- Ensure automations are configured in HA
- The Supervisor API must be accessible (check app logs)

**App takes long to start**
- The web UI loads instantly. Background services start after the Supervisor API is ready — typically 30–60 seconds after HA boot.
